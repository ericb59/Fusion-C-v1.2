MKDIR
-----

Format:      MKDIR [d:]path
		  or
	     MD [d:]path

Purpose:     Creates a new sub-directory.

Use:	     The  last item in the path is the name of the new  sub-
	directory which is to be created on the default or specified
	drive.  Thus if this is the only item in the path,  the  new
	directory  is created in the current directory.  If the  new
	directory  is to be hidden,  then it must be separately made
	hidden with the ATDIR command.

	     The  MD  command  is an abbreviated form of  the  MKDIR
	command provided for convenience and MS-DOS compatibility.

Examples:

	MKDIR UTIL

	     A  directory  called  UTIL is created  in  the  current
	directory of the current drive.

	MKDIR A:\UTIL\RAM

	     A directory called RAM is created in the UTIL directory
	in the root directory of drive A:.
