PATH
----

Format:      PATH [[+|-] [d:]path [[d:]path [[d:]path...]]]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the COM and BAT command search path.

Use:	     If  no  parameters are printed,  then the  search  path
	currently  set will be displayed,  separated by  semi-colons
	(';').

	     If  + or - is not given,  then the search path will  be
	set  to the list of path names given and any existing search
	path will be deleted.

	     If - is given before the list of paths,  then each path
	in  the list will be deleted from the currently  set  search
	path,  and  an error will be given if any of the given paths
	do not already exist.

	     If + is given before the list of paths,  then each path
	specified  will  first  be deleted from  the  currently  set
	search  path if it exists,  and will then be added onto  the
	end.  This allows the order of the paths in the search  path
	to be changed and allows new paths to be appended to the end
	of the current search path. The + syntax can also be used to
	set  a search path longer than can be given in one  command,
	the  maximum length of the search path being 255  characters
	and the maximum length of a command 127 characters.

	     When searching for a COM or BAT file,  the paths in the
	current  search  path  will be used in order  from  left  to
	right.  It  is recommended that the paths in the search path
	are  specified as full paths starting at the root  directory
	and with the drive specified.  If this is not the case, then
	the meaning of the search path could change when the current
	drive or directory is changed.

	     The  search path is stored as an environment item  (see
	HELP ENV on Environment Items),  and so can also be accessed
	with the SET command.

Examples:

	PATH E:\COM E:\BAT

	     When  a  COM or BAT command is next searched  for,  the
	directories  searched will be the current directory  of  the
	current  drive,  the COM directory in the root directory  of
	drive  E:  and  the BAT directory in the root  directory  of
	drive E:, in that order.

	PATH
	; E:\COM; E:\BAT

	     No parameters were given so the current search path was
	printed.

	PATH +A:\COM; A:\BAT

	     The  directories A:\COM and A:\BAT are added to the end
	of the search path.

	PATH
	; E:\COM; E:\BAT; A:\COM; A:\BAT

	     The new search path is printed.

	PATH -E:\COM, E:\BAT

	     The  directories E:\COM and E:\BAT are deleted from the
	current search path.

	PATH
	; A:\COM; A:\BAT

	     The new search path is again printed.
