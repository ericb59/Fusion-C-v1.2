ECHO
----

Format:      ECHO [text]

Purpose:     Prints text in a batch file.

Use:	     The text is simply displayed on the screen.  If no text
	is given, then just a blank line is output.

	     This  command  should not be confused with  the  'echo'
	state in batch files,  which is controlled by an environment
	item called ECHO (see HELP ENV on Environment Items).

Examples:

	ECHO AUTOEXEC batch file executed
	AUTOEXEC batch file executed

	     The specified text ('AUTOEXEC batch file executed') was
	printed on the screen.

	ECHO

	     No  parameters  were given,  so just a blank  line  was
	printed.
