PAUSE
-----

Format:      PAUSE [comment]

Purpose:     Prompts and waits for a key press in a batch file.

Use:	     The  comments  consists  of an  arbitrary  sequence  of
	characters.

	     The  comment,  if  given,  is printed followed  by  the
	prompt 'Press any key to continue... ' on the next line. The
	system  will then wait for a key to be pressed and will echo
	the  key  pressed  if it is a  printable  character.  If  no
	comment is given as a parameter,  then just the prompt  will
	be printed.

	     The  main use of this command is to issue prompts  from
	within a batch file.

Examples:

	PAUSE
	Press any key to continue...

	     No comment was given, so just the prompt was printed.

	PAUSE Insert document disk in drive B:
	Insert document disk in drive B:
	Press any key to continue

	     The  comment  given was 'Insert document disk in  drive
	B:' so this was printed followed by the prompt.
