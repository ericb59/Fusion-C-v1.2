HELP
----

Format:      HELP [subject]

Purpose:     Provides on-line help for an MSX-DOS feature.

Use:	     If  no  parameter  is given,  then a list  of  standard
	subjects  on  which  help  is  available  is  printed.  This
	includes  all  the commands and the major  system  features.
	Other non-standard help subjects may also be available  with
	commercial programs.

	     If  a  subject  is specified,  then help text  on  this
	subject  is printed on the screen from a 'help  file'.  This
	will  pause  at  the  end of every screen  until  a  key  is
	pressed.

	     Help files have a filename of:

		  subject.HLP

	and are located by default on the standard MSX-DOS boot disk
	in a directory called HELP.

	     An environment item called HELP is set up initially  to
	refer  to  the HELP directory  (see HELP ENV on  Environment
	Items). This can be changed with the SET command to refer to
	any other directory or disk if required.

	     Any  HELP subject can be added by the user for his  own
	use  simply by adding the appropriate .HLP file in the  HELP
	directory.  The  help file will be displayed very much  like
	the  TYPE command would display it.

Examples:

	HELP

	     A  general help screen is printed.  This lists all  the
	subjects  on  which  help is available,  including  all  the
	commands and main features of MSX-DOS.

	HELP XCOPY

	     Help information on the XCOPY command is printed.  This
	includes  a description of how to use the command  and  what
	options are available.

	HELP ME
	*** File for HELP not found

	     This  command  caused  HELP to look for a  file  called
	ME.HLP from which to get the help text,  but did not find it
	so printed the error message.  The files containing the help
	text  are normally found in a directory called \HELP on  the
	drive  from  which MSX-DOS was booted,  and any  other  help
	files  may be added if required.  If ME.HLP was  added  then
	HELP ME would print it on the screen.
