DISKCOPY
--------

Format:      DISKCOPY [d: [d:]] [/X]

Purpose:     Copies one disk to another.

Use:	     The first drive is the source drive and the second  the
	destination,  which  defaults  to the current drive.  If  no
	drives  are given,  then DISKCOPY will prompt for  both  the
	source and the destination.

	     Before  DISKCOPY is used,  the destination disk must be
	formatted  with the same format as the source disk,  and  an
	error will be given if this is not the case.

	     If  /X is given,  then various messages printed  during
	the disk copy operation will be suppressed.

	     Note that this is a transient command,  and must there-
	fore be loaded from disk.

Examples:

	DISKCOPY A: B:
	Insert source disk in drive A:
	Insert target disk in drive B:
	Press any key to continue...

	     The command was given to copy the disk in drive  A:  to
	the  disk in drive B:,  thus destroying all existing data on
	the disk in drive B: The prompt is printed first.

	DISKCOPY B:

	     The  disk  in  drive B:  is copied to the disk  in  the
	current drive.

	DISKCOPY
	source drive?
	target drive?

	     The DISKCOPY command was given with no  parameters,  so
	the  source  and destination disks were  prompted  for.  The
	reply to the prompts consists of just a single drive letter.
