FIXDISK
-------

Format:      FIXDISK [d:] [/S]

Purpose:     Updates a disk to the full MSX-DOS 2 format.

Use:	     The  default or specified drive specifies the drive  on
	which FIXDISK is to operate.

	     This  command is mainly used to update MSX-DOS 1  disks
	to full MSX-DOS 2 compatibility,  but may also be useful for
	updating other disks of a similar format.

	     Although  the disk format used by MSX-DOS 1 and MSX-DOS
	2  is standardized,  MSX-DOS 1 does not use the  information
	stored on certain parts of the disk (the boot sector) and so
	this  information  is not necessarily correct on  MSX-DOS  1
	disks.  This can cause problems when MSX-DOS 2 is used  with
	these disks.  Additionally, the MSX-DOS 2 UNDEL command will
	only  work  with disks that were formatted using  MSX-DOS  2
	(i.e. disks  that have a 'volume id' in the boot sector) and
	so will not work with MSX-DOS 1 disks or disks formatted  on
	other  systems.

	     The FIXDISK command will correct the information on the
	boot sector so that these disks can be used with MSX-DOS 2.

	     If /S option is also given, FIXDISK will update a  disk
	so that it is fully MSX-DOS 2 compatible,  and it's use will
	allow full use of MSX-DOS 2 disk features.  When a disk  has
	been updated in this way, however, it may no longer be fully
	compatible with the original system,  although it will still
	be  readable and writeable under that system.  For  example,
	if  a  FIXDISK command is used on an application disk  which
	directly starts up from the boot code, then that  disk  will
	no longer be able to boot that application.

	     To  help prevent accidental updates of boot disks  from
	other systems, a prompt is issued before updating a disk.

	     Note  that  FIXDISK is a transient  command,  and  must
	therefore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

	FIXDISK B: /S
	Disk in drive B: will only be able to boot MSX-DOS
	Press any key to continue...

	     Drive  B:  will  be  updated  to  be  fully  MSX-DOS  2
	compatible.  Since  the disk may have been a boot disk  from
	another  system,  a  prompt  is issued before  the  disk  is
	actually updated.
