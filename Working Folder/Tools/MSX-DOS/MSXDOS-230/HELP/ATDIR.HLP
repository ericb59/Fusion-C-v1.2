ATDIR
-----

Format:      ATDIR +|-H [/H] [/P] compound-filespec

Purpose:     Changes  the  attributes  of directories to  make  them
	hidden/not hidden.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies the directories  whose
	attributes are to be changed.

	     If  +H  is given,  then the  selected  directories  are
	marked  as  hidden,  and  will  not  be  affected  by  other
	directory  commands  or shown by a DIR command unless  a  /H
	option is given with those commands. The -H option marks the
	selected  directories as not hidden,  and will not have  any
	effect  unless  the  /H  option  is  given.  The  files  and
	directories   within  the  specified  directories  are   not
	affected.

	     Unlike files, directories cannot be made read only.

	     When  an error occurs,  the erroneous directory name is
	printed followed by an error message,  and the command  will
	continue with the next directory. If many errors occur, then
	the  /P  option can be used to cause the output to pause  at
	the end of the screen.

	     The  DIR /H command can be used to indicate the current
	attributes of directories.

Examples:

	ATDIR +H DIR1

	     Marks the directory called DIR1 as hidden.

	ATDIR -H DIR1/H

	     Marks the hidden directory DIR1 as not hidden.

	ATDIR +H DIR?

	     Marks  all  directories matching DIR?  as  hidden  (for
	example DIR1, DIR2 and DIR3).

	ATDIR +H \DIR1+\DIR2

	     Marks  the  DIR1 directory and the  DIR2  directory  as
	hidden.
