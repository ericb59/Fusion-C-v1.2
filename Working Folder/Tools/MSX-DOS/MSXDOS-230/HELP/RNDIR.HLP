RNDIR
-----

Format:      RNDIR [/H] [/P] compound-filespec filename

Purpose:     Renames one or more sub-directories.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies the  directories  that
	are  to be renamed,  and /H allows hidden directories to  be
	included  in  the  rename operation.  The  contents  of  the
	directories remain unchanged.

	     The  second  filename specifies the new  name  for  the
	directories.  A  '?'  in  the new name  indicates  that  the
	corresponding character from the name of the directory being
	renamed  will  be used,  thus allowing an ambiguous  rename.
	Thus '*' in the second filename, which is just equivalent to
	a series of '?'s,  indicates that the whole of the  filename
	or extension of the directory name will remain unchanged.

	     If  for  some reason a particular directory  cannot  be
	renamed (eg.  if a file or directory of the new name already
	exists)  then the offending directory name will  be  printed
	along  with  an error message and the rename operation  will
	continue with the next directory. If many errors occur, then
	/P will cause the output to pause at the end of the screen.

Examples:

	RNDIR UTIL COM

	     The  directory called UTIL in the current directory  of
	the current drive is renamed COM.

	RNDIR A:\*.*/H/P *.OLD
	UTIL -- Directory exists

	     All  directories,  hidden and not hidden,  in the  root
	directory of drive A: are renamed with an extension of .OLD.
	The  directory UTIL could not be renamed because a directory
	called UTIL.OLD already existed,  so the error was  printed.
	If  many  such  errors were printed then /P  would  cause  a
	prompt to be printed at the end of every screen full.

	RNDIR COM + BAT *.OLD

	     The  directories COM and BAT are renamed to COM.OLD and
	BAT.OLD respectively.
