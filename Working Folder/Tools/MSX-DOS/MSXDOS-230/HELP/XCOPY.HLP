XCOPY
-----

Format:      XCOPY [filespec [filespec]] [options]

Purpose:     Copies files and directories from one disk to another.

Use:	     The options available are:

		   [/A] [/E] [/H] [/M] [/P] [/S] [/T] [/V] [/W]

	     XCOPY is an extended file copying command (compare with
	the  COPY command) that can selectively copy both files  and
	directories.   The  first  filespec specifies   the   source
	filenames, and if /H is given then hidden files will also be
	copied.  The  second  filespec is the destination  filename.
	Thus  files  can  be  renamed during the  copy  (as  in  the
	standard COPY command).

	     /T will cause the copied files to have the current date
	and time rather than the source file's date and time.

	     If  /A is specified, then only files with the 'archive'
	attribute set are copied. A file has an archive attribute in
	the  same  way  as a 'hidden' attribute and  a  'read  only'
	attribute.  It  is set whenever a file is  updated  (written
	to).

	     /M  is similar to /A,  but resets the archive bit after
	copying  the file.  Thus,  using this option,  files can  be
	regularly  copied onto another disk only if they  have  been
	updated, providing a file backup facility.

	     /S  causes XCOPY to copy directories as well as  files.
	Within  each directory,  all files are copied and  then  any
	matching  files within each directory are copied,  with  the
	directory  being  created on the destination if it does  not
	already  exist.  Normally,  these  directories will  not  be
	created if no files are to be copied into them.

	     /E  can  be given to cause the /S option to create  all
	directories, even if they are empty.

	     The  /P  option  will cause XCOPY to pause  and  prompt
	before  copying  each  file,   which  allows  files  to   be
	selectively copied.

	     /W  causes XCOPY to pause and prompt before copying any
	files, so that disks can be changed.

	     The  /V option can be given to turn write  verification
	on  for  the duration of the XCOPY command (see  the  VERIFY
	command). This will ensure that data is written correctly to
	disks but will slow the operation down.

	     Note that XCOPY is a transient command,  and so must be
	loaded off disk.

Examples:

	XCOPY B:\

	     All files in the root directory of drive B:  are copied
	to the current directory of the current drive. There  is  no
	advantage  in  this case over  using  the standard  built-in
	COPY command.

	XCOPY *.* B: /H/S/M

		     All files,  including hidden files,  are copied
	to drive B:  only if they have been modified since a similar
	command  was  last  given.  The files  are  then  marked  as
	unmodified.  Not  only  are  all the files  in  the  current
	directory  copied,  but  so  are directories and  all  their
	descendant directories and files.
