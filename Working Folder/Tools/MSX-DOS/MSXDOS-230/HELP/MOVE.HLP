MOVE
----

Format:      MOVE [/H] [/P] compound-filespec [path]

Purpose:     Moves files from one place to another on a disk.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies which files are to  be
	moved,  and  /H  allows hidden files to be included  in  the
	move.

	     The path specifies the directory to which the files are
	to be moved, the current directory being used if this is not
	given.  The  path must exist on each drive referenced by the
	filespecs in the compound-filespec.

	     If a particular file cannot be moved into the specified
	or current directory (eg. if a file of the same name already
	exists) then the offending filename is printed along with an
	error  message,  and the move operation continues  with  the
	next  file.  If many errors occur,  then the /P option  will
	cause the output to pause at the bottom of the screen.

Examples:

	MOVE FILE1 \

	     The  file FILE1 is moved from the current directory  of
	the  current  drive  to the root directory  of  the  current
	drive.

	MOVE /H /P E:*.COM \
	COMMAND2.COM -- File exists

	     All files matching *.COM,  both hidden and not  hidden,
	in  the current directory of drive E:  are moved to the root
	directory  of  that drive.  The  file  COMMAND2.COM  already
	existed  in  the root directory,  so the error was  printed.
	Neither of the COMMAND2.COM files were moved or altered.  If
	many  such errors had occurred then a prompt would have been
	printed after a screen full.

	MOVE \UTIL\*.COM + \UTIL\*.BAT

	     All files matching *.COM or *.BAT in a directory called
	UTIL on the current drive are moved to the current directory
	of that drive.
