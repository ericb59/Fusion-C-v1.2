DATE
----

Format:      DATE [date]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the current date.

Use:	     If the date is given after the command,  then the  date
	is set to this value (for the format see below). If the date
	is  not  given after the command,  then the current day  and
	date is printed and the new date is prompted for and  input.
	If  no  input  is given (i.e. if the 'enter'  key  alone  is
	pressed) then the current date is not altered. Otherwise the
	input  is  assumed to be a new date,  and is interpreted  as
	described  below.  If  the  date is invalid  then  an  error
	message is displayed and the new date again prompted for and
	input.

	     The date is expected to consist of up to three numbers,
	separated by one of the following characters:

	     space tab , - . / :

	with  spaces  allowed  either side  of  the  character.  Any
	missing  numbers  will default to the current  setting.  The
	year may either be a full century and year,  or may be  just
	the  year  in which case the century defaults to 19  if  the
	year is greater than 80 or 20 otherwise.

	     The  format  in which the date is printed and input  is
	flexible and can be changed. An environment item called DATE
	is set up by default to a format that is appropriate for the
	country  of  origin  of the MSX machine  (see  HELP  ENV  on
	Environment  Items).  For example,  on Japanese machines the
	default setting is YY-MM-DD.  The command SET DATE  DD-MM-YY
	will  change  the date format to the UK format.  The  format
	also affects the dates printed by the DIR command.

	     If  the DATE environment item is defined,  then it will
	be  printed  by the DATE command to indicate the  format  in
	which the date is required to be input.

Examples:

	DATE 86-6-18

	     The current date is set to the 18th June 1986.

	DATE
	Current date is Wed 1986-06-18
	Enter new date (yy-mm-dd): - -19

	     No  parameter  was given,  so the current date of  18th
	June  1986 was printed and a new date prompted for.  In  the
	reply to the prompt, the date was updated to the next day by
	only specifying the 19th.  Since the year and month were not
	given, they remained the same.

	SET DATE = DD/MM/YY

	     The date format has been changed to the UK format.

	DATE
	Current date is Thu 19-06-1986
	Enter new date (DD/MM/YY):

	     No  parameter was given,  so the current date  of  19th
	June  1986  was  printed in the UK format,  and  the  prompt
	printed. The reply is expected in the UK format.
