REDIRECTION AND PIPING
----------------------

	     COMMAND2.COM provides facilities called redirection and
	piping  as is described hereafter.  However,  an environment
	item  REDIR  exists which can be set to OFF  (by  using  SET
	REDIR   OFF  command)  to  cause  COMMAND2.COM  bypass   any
	interpretation  of  redirection  or  piping  symbols.   When
	command  line  is executed in this way,  these  symbols  are
	passed to the command as it is typed.  The command SET REDIR
	ON will restore the normal state.

REDIRECTION

	     Most  commands,  CP/M  programs  and  MSX-DOS  programs
	output  text  to  the screen by  writing  to  the  'standard
	output',  and  read  from the keyboard by reading  from  the
	'standard input'. COMMAND2.COM, however, provides facilities
	for  changing the standard input and standard output for the
	duration of the command to refer to other MSX-DOS devices or
	to files on disk by including one or more of the redirection
	symbols  <,  >  and >> on the command line,  followed  by  a
	filename.

	     For  example,  the ECHO command normally  just  outputs
	it's  parameters to the screen by writing the characters  to
	the standard output. It can be made to output to the printer
	instead by redirecting it's output, as follows:

		  ECHO text >PRN

	which changes the standard output to refer to the device PRN
	for  the  duration  of  the  ECHO  command.  Similarly,  the
	command:

		  ECHO text >filespec

	will cause the specified file to be created,  and the output
	of  the  ECHO  command written to the file.  To  append  the
	output of a command to the end of an existing file,  the  >>
	symbol  can  be used instead of the > symbol,  and the  file
	will only be created if it does not already exist.

	     To change the standard input, the < symbol is used in a
	similar manner to the > symbol.  In this case, the file must
	already  exist,  and  must contain adequate  input  for  the
	command.  If  the command attempts to read input beyond  the
	end  of  the file,  then it will be aborted since it  cannot
	continue.

	     When  redirection information is given on  the  command
	line,  it  is used by COMMAND2.COM to set up the redirection
	and then removed from the command line. Thus in the examples
	above,  the  ECHO  command  will not  echo  the  redirection
	symbols or the filename.

	     If  the input or output of a batch file is  redirected,
	then that redirection is applied to all commands within  the
	batch  file.  Individual commands within the batch file  may
	still be redirected,  however, which will override the batch
	file  redirection.  See HELP BATCH on Batch Files  for  more
	information on commands in batch files.

PIPING

	     As  well  as  redirecting  the input and  output  of  a
	command or program to another device or a disk file,  it  is
	possible  to  redirect or 'pipe' the standard output of  one
	command  into the standard input of another.  Typically  the
	second  command  will  be a program which  reads  from  it's
	standard  input,  modifies the data,  and writes it to  it's
	standard output.  Such a program is called a  'filter'.  For
	example,  a  filter  could be produced which read data  from
	it's standard input,  sorted it into alphabetical order, and
	wrote it to it's standard output. Thus the output of the DIR
	command could be sorted.

	     Piping  is indicated on the command line by  separating
	the two commands by the | symbol. The command to the left of
	the  | symbol will be performed first,  and it's output will
	be  redirected to a temporary file created by  COMMAND2.COM.
	Then  the  second  command  will  be  performed,  with  it's
	standard input redirected from the same temporary file. When
	the second command ends, the temporary file will be deleted.
	The standard output of the second command may of course have
	been piped into the standard input of a third  command,  and
	so on.

	     If  any  input  redirection occurs on  a  command  line
	involving  a  pipe,  then the redirection is applied to  the
	first command in the pipe, as all the other commands receive
	their  standard  input  from  the  standard  output  of  the
	previous  command  in the pipe.  Similarly,  if  any  output
	redirection occurs on a command line involving a pipe,  then
	the  redirection  will  apply to the  last  command  on  the
	command line.

	     It  is not possible to use pipes on either the input or
	the output of batch files directly. It is, however, possible
	to use piping with batch files if they are executed with the
	COMMAND2  command (see HELP COMMAND2) since it is  then  the
	COMMAND2 command that is being redirected and not the  batch
	file.

	     As mentioned above,  in order to pipe the output of one
	command into the input of another,  temporary files will  be
	created  and deleted by COMMAND2.COM.  The location of these
	temporary  files is specified by the TEMP  environment  item
	(see  HELP ENV  on  Environment  Items),  and  this  may  be
	changed  to  refer to any drive and directory  (for  example
	piping  will be speeded up considerably if TEMP refers to  a
	directory  on a RAM disk).  By default,  TEMP refers to  the
	root  directory of the boot disk.  The filename used for the
	temporary  file is created by COMMAND2.COM,  so TEMP  should
	specify just the drive and directory. The filename is of the
	form %PIPExxx.$$$  where  xxx is a three digit number chosen
	by COMMAND2.COM to avoid clashes with any other files in the
	TEMP directory.
