RD
--

Format:      RD [/H] [/P] compound-filespec
		       or
	     RMDIR [/H] [/P] compound-filespec

Purpose:     Removes one or more sub-directories.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies which directories  are
	to  be  deleted,  and  /H allows hidden  directories  to  be
	included in the delete operation.

	     If  a directory cannot be deleted for some reason  (eg.
	it is not empty) then the name of the offending directory is
	printed  along  with  an  error  message,   and  the  delete
	operation continues with the next directory.  If many errors
	occur  then /P will cause the output to pause at the end  of
	the screen.

Examples:

	RMDIR DIR1

	     The  directory called DIR1 in the current directory  of
	the current drive is removed.

	RD B:\COM + B:\BAT

	     The  directories COM and BAT are removed from the  root
	directory of drive B:.

	RD \*.*
	UTIL -- Directory not empty

	     An attempt was made to remove all directories from  the
	root directory of the current drive,  but a directory called
	UTIL  was not empty and so the error was printed.  UTIL  and
	it's contents are not affected at all.
