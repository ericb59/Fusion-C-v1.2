DIR
---

Format:      DIR [/H] [/W] [/P] [compound-filespec]

Purpose:     Displays the names of files on disk.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies which files are to  be
	listed.  If  the /H option is given,  then hidden files will
	also be listed.

	     In  the DIR command,  unlike all other commands,  it is
	permissible  to not give the main filename or  the  filename
	extension,  and both will default to '*'. Thus a filename of
	'FRED' is equivalent to 'FRED.*' and a filename of '.COM' is
	equivalent to '*.COM'.  Note that if the '.' at the end of a
	main  filename is given,  then the extension is also assumed
	to  have  been given,  so that the filename 'FRED.'  is  not
	equivalent to 'FRED.*', unlike the example above.

	     There are two formats of the listing.  If the /W option
	is  given,  then a 'wide' listing is printed,  with  several
	filenames  output  per  line.   Sub-directory  names,   file
	attributes,  and the date and time each file was created are
	not displayed.

	     If  the /W option is not given,  then the filenames are
	printed  with  one  filename per  line,  together  with  the
	attributes, the file size and the date and time at which the
	file was last modified. The attributes are printed as an 'r'
	if  the file is read-only and an 'h' if the file  is  hidden
	(and  /H is given).  If the time of a file is zero (i.e. the
	file  does not have an associated time) then the time  field
	will  not be printed.  If the date of a file is  zero,  then
	neither  the date nor the time fields will be  printed.  The
	formats  in which the dates and times are printed in can  be
	changed (see HELP DATE and HELP TIME).

	     The  non-/W  display  is designed to fit  within  a  40
	column screen,  but if fewer columns are available then some
	fields  of the listing will not be shown so that the display
	will  always fit on one line.  The number of files per  line
	that  are  printed  when /W is specified  is  also  adjusted
	according  to the screen width.  If the width of the display
	is less than 13 characters however,  then in both cases  the
	filenames will wrap to the next line.

	     At the top of the list of files, the volume name of the
	disk  and  the  name  of  the  directory  being  listed   is
	displayed.  At the bottom,  the number of files listed,  the
	total  number  of  bytes  in the files  and  the  amount  of
	remaining disk space is printed.

	     When  the directory of a sub-directory is printed,  the
	first   two  items  listed  will  always  be   two   special
	sub-directories called '.' and '..'. These are automatically
	created  when  a new directory is created,  and it is  these
	that allow '.' and '..' to be given in path names to signify
	the  current and parent directories respectively  (see  HELP
	SYNTAX for a description of paths).

	     When  printing  a  number  of  bytes,   the  number  is
	truncated  and  printed as the number of kilobytes if 1K  or
	greater.

	     If the /P option is given,  then the output will  pause
	at the bottom of the screen until a key is pressed.

Examples:

	DIR

	     All  filenames  and  directory  names  in  the  current
	directory of the current drive will be printed.  This  might
	be as follows:

	      Volume in drive A: is MSX-DOS 2
	      Directory of A:\

	     MSXDOS2  SYS r    4096 86-06-19  2:45p
	     COMMAND2 COM r   10496 86-06-19  2:46p
	     UTILS           <dir>  86-06-19  2:50p
	     HELP            <dir>  86-06-19  2:50p
	      14K in 2 files   222K free

	The   disk  thus  contains  the  two  MSX-DOS  system  files
	MSXDOS2.SYS and COMMAND2.COM,  which are read only,  and two
	directories called UTILS and HELP.

	DIR B:\HELP/W

	     A  'wide'  directory format has been requested  of  the
	HELP directory on drive B:. This might be as follows:

	      Volume in drive B: is MSX-DOS 2
	      Directory of B:\HELP

	     BUFFERS .HLP    ATTRIB  .HLP    ASSIGN  .HLP
	     ATDIR   .HLP    CHDIR   .HLP    CD      .HLP
	     SYNTAX  .HLP    ENV     .HLP    BATCH   .HLP
	     EDITING .HLP
	      25K in 10 files   222K free

	DIR  UTILS + HELP/P

	     This will list all the files in the UTILS directory and
	all  the files in the HELP directory,  and will pause at the
	end of every screen full.

	DIR .COM

	     No main filename was given,  and so defaults to *. Thus
	this command is equivalent to the command DIR *.COM.

	DIR COMMAND2

	     No extension was given,  so this defaults to  .*.  Thus
	this command is equivalent to the command DIR COMMAND2.*.
