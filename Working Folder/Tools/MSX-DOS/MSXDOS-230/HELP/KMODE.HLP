KMODE
-----

Format:      KMODE number|OFF
		or
             KMODE [number|OFF] /S [d:]

Purpose:     Sets or resets  'Kanji Screen Mode',  or  updates  boot
	code  so  that  it  automatically installs Kanji Driver then
	selects screen mode.

Use:	     Number specifies the  'Kanji Screen Mode'.  The  number
	ranges  from  0  to  3 and has the same meaning as its BASIC
	counterpart  'CALL  KANJI<n>'  statement.   Specifying   OFF
	restores  screen  mode  to  ANK  (MSX  native screen modes).
	Unless Kanji Driver is installed (by  typing  CALL  KANJI<n>
	statement  from  BASIC  or  automatically  by 'Kanji Boot'),
	screen modes will not change.

	     If /S option is specified then the boot code of default
	or specified drive is updated.  In this case, If mode is not
	specified  then  current screen mode is used.  When the disk
	is updated in this way, the boot code will always be  'Kanji
	Boot' which is no longer be able to boot MSX-DOS 1.

	     To  help prevent accidental updates of boot disks  from
	other systems, a prompt is issued before updating a disk.

	     Note that  KMODE  is  a  transient  command,  and  must
	therefore be loaded off disk.

Examples:

	KMODE 3

	     'Kanji screen mode' will be set to 3 if  'Kanji driver'
	is installed.

	KMODE OFF

	     Screen mode is set back to native MSX text screen.

	KMODE /S B:
	Disk in drive B: will only be able to boot MSX-DOS 2
	Press any key to continue...

	     Drive B: will be updated to 'Kanji Boot'.  Since 'Kanji
	Boot'  will not boot anything from disk,  a prompt is issued
	before the disk is actually updated.

	     Booting  from  this  disk  will  automatically  install
	the Kanji Driver then set screen mode, in this case, to  ANK
	(i.e. screen mode will not alter).
