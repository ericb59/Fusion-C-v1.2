CONCAT
------

Format:      CONCAT [/H] [/P] [/A] [/B] [/V] source filespec

Purpose:     Concatenates (joins together) files or devices.

Use:	     The definition of the source is:

		  compound-filespec

	The  compound-filespec specifies the files or  devices  that
	are to be joined together, and /H allows hidden files to  be
	joined.

	     The  second  parameter  is  a  filespec  that  must  be
	unambiguous and is created before the source files are read.
	Each  source file is then read,  joined onto the end of  the
	previous one and written out to the destination.

	     As each source file is read,  it's filename is printed.
	If  for some reason the file cannot be read (eg.  it is  the
	file  that  has  been created as the destination)  then  the
	filename  is  followed by an error message  and  the  CONCAT
	operation continues with the next source file. If many files
	are  being  concatenated,  then /P will cause the output  to
	pause at the end of the screen until a key is pressed.

	     Normally,  the  concatenation  is  performed  on  ASCII
	files.  Source  files  are read up to the first  end-of-file
	character  (CTRL-Z)  and a single end-of-file  character  is
	appended to the destination after all data has been  written
	out.  If,  however,  /B is given,  then no interpretation is
	given to the data read and no additional data is added.

	     It  is also possible to give the /B to the  destination
	or to any of the filespecs in the compound-filespec,  and it
	will then refer only to those files. /A may also be given to
	reverse the effect of /B.

	     The  /V option can be given to turn write  verification
	on  for  the duration of the CONCAT command (see the  VERIFY
	command). This will ensure that data is written correctly to
	disks but will slow the operation down.

	     If  CONCAT  gives  a 'Not  enough  memory'  error  then
	probably  reducing  the number of buffers (see  the  BUFFERS
	command)  or removing some environment items  (see HELP  ENV
	on Environment Items) will free up sufficient memory.

Examples:

	CONCAT *.DOC ALL.PRN

	     A  new  file called ALL.PRN is created,  and all  files
	matching  *.DOC  (for  example  FILE1.DOC,   FILE2.DOC   and
	FILE3.DOC)  are joined together  and written to the new file
	in the order that they are found on disk.  Any existing file
	called ALL.PRN will be overwritten.

	CONCAT /H /P *.DOC ALL.DOC
	ALL.DOC -- Destination file cannot be concatenated

	     A  new  file called ALL.DOC is created,  and all  files
	matching  *.DOC are joined together and written to  the  new
	file  in  the order that they are found on disk.  Since  the
	destination  file ALL.DOC also matched the  source  filename
	*.DOC,  the message is printed and it is not included in the
	concatenation.

	CONCAT /B  FILE2.DOC + FILE3.DOC + FILE1.DOC  ALL.DOC

	     A new file ALL.DOC is created, and the files FILE2.DOC,
	FILE3.DOC  and  FILE1.DOC and joined together in that  order
	and  written to the new file.  They are joined  together  in
	binary mode.
