ASSIGN
------

Format:      ASSIGN [d: [d:]]

Purpose:     Sets up the logical to physical translation of drives.

Use:	     If  no  drives  are  given,   then  all  current  drive
	assignments are cancelled.

	     If only one drive is given,  then the physical drive to
	which this refers is printed.

	     If both drives are given,  then the first drive is  the
	drive  which MSX-DOS currently uses,  and the second is  the
	drive which MSX-DOS will subsequently use.

Examples:

	ASSIGN

	     Un-assigns all previous drive assignments.

	ASSIGN A: B:

	     Assigns drive A: to drive B:, so that all accesses that
	previously would go to drive A: go instead to drive B:

	ASSIGN A:
	A:=B:

	     Displays  the drive to which A:  is currently assigned,
	which in this case is B:.
