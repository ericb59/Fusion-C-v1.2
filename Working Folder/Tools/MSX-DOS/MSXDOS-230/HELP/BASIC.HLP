BASIC
-----

Format:      BASIC [program]

Purpose:     Transfers control to MSX disk BASIC.

Use:	     Program is the name of a BASIC program on disk.

	     Control is passed to the built-in MSX BASIC, which will
	load  and execute the BASIC program if specified.  If a  RAM
	disk has been set up, then it can still be used from BASIC.

	     The  BASIC  command _SYSTEM("command") can be  used  to
	return to MSX-DOS,  and the optional command,  which can  be
	any command mentioned in this manual,  will be executed.  If
	the  command  is  not  given,   then  a  batch  file  called
	REBOOT.BAT  will be  searched  for  and  executed  (see HELP
	BATCH on Batch Files).

Examples

	BASIC

	     MSX disk BASIC is entered.

	BASIC MYPROG.BAS

	     MSX  disk  BASIC  is entered,  and  the  BASIC  program
	MYPROG.BAS loaded and RUN.
