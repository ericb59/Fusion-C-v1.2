RAMDISK
-------

Format:      RAMDISK [number[K]] [/D]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the RAM disk size.

Use:	     If  no parameters are given,  then the current  RAMDISK
	size is displayed as the number of kilobytes.

	     The  number,  if given,  specifies the maximum size for
	the new RAM disk, and is specified in kilobytes. This figure
	will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of 16K since  the
	RAM  disk  is always a multiple of 16K.  A RAM disk  smaller
	then  the specified maximum size may be created if there  is
	not  enough free memory for the full size,  although a  'not
	enough memory' error will be given if there is no memory  at
	all  available  for  the  RAM disk.  Note  that  the  number
	specified  is the maximum amount of RAM to use for  the  RAM
	disk,  which  is not the same as the maximum amount of  free
	space  available  on  the newly-created RAM disk  since  the
	system needs to use some.

	     If  a  RAM  disk already exists before  a  new  one  is
	created, then a 'Destroy all data on RAM disk (Y/N)?' prompt
	is printed to avoid accidental loss of data. /D can be given
	which will automatically delete any existing RAM disk first,
	thus suppressing the prompt.

	     Having  created a RAM disk,  it can be referred  to  as
	drive H:.

	     The  RAMDISK  command  is  normally  only  used  in  an
	AUTOEXEC.BAT  batch file,  with a large number specified  so
	that  as large a RAMDISK as possible is created.  It is  not
	advisable to keep any data on a RAM disk except for a  short
	length of time that is not also kept on a floppy disk, since
	it will be lost if,  for example,  the power to the computer
	fails.

Examples:

	RAMDISK
	RAMDISK=160K

	     No  parameters  were  given,  so the  current  size  is
	printed, in this case 160K.

	RAMDISK
	*** RAM disk does not exist

	     No  parameters  were  given but no RAM  disk  has  been
	created, so the error is given.
	RAMDISK = 300
	Destroy all data on RAM disk (Y/N)? y

	     A RAM disk already existed,  so the prompt was printed.
	In this case,  the reply was 'y' so the current RAM disk was
	deleted and the new one set up with a maximum size of 300K.
