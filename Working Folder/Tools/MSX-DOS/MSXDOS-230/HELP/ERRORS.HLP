ERRORS AND MESSAGES
-------------------

DISK ERRORS

	     Disk   errors  occur  when  a  command  or  program  is
	attempting to access a disk and fails for some reason,  such
	as a disk not being in the drive. When this happens, message
	and  prompt appears which allows the user the  either  retry
	the  operation  which may now work (eg.  if a disk has  been
	inserted  into  the drive),  to ignore the operation  or  to
	abort the entire command.

	     An example disk error message and prompt is as follows,
	and  may be given if the disk was taken out whilst drive  A:
	was being accessed:

		  Not ready reading drive A:
		  Abort, Retry or Ignore (A/R/I)?

	The  'not ready' part of the message indicates why the  disk
	operation failed, and other possibilities exist (see below).
	'reading' indicates that the command was trying to read  the
	disk,  and  may be replaced by 'writing' if that is what  it
	was  doing.  'drive  A:' is the drive in which the disk  was
	attempted to be accessed.

	     The  'Abort,   Retry  or  Ignore'  part  indicates  the
	possible  actions that can be taken by the user,  and  these
	are selected by pressing the 'A',  'R' or 'I' key.

	     If  Abort  is  selected,  then the  entire  command  is
	aborted and the message 'Disk operation aborted' is  printed
	before another command can be typed.

	     If  Retry  is selected then the failed  disk  operation
	will  simply  be  retried and may fail again  or  may  work,
	particularly  if some corrective action has been taken  such
	as inserting a missing disk.

	     Ignore  causes the failed disk operation to be  ignored
	by the command.  In many cases, ignoring an error may not be
	recommended  and in these cases the Ignore option  will  not
	even be displayed,  although it may still be selected. Doing
	so  may  however cause serious system malfunction and  could
	destroy  data  on the disk.  Even if the  Ignore  option  is
	displayed,  it should be used with extreme caution, and only
	when  all else fails.  Normally Ignore is only used when the
	data on a disk has got corrupted and ignoring the disk error
	offers the only possibility of recovering all or part of the
	data.

	     A few serious errors which generally mean the disk  has
	been   corrupted  beyond  possible  use  are   automatically
	aborted,  and  just the appropriate error message is printed
	(eg. 'Bad file allocation table').

	     The  possible errors that can occur as disk errors  and
	their meanings are, in alphabetical order, as follows:

	Bad file allocation table

	     The  disk  contains  an invalid file  allocation  table
	(FAT).  The FAT is an area on disk in which the system keeps
	information  to tell it where on the disk the data  in  each
	file is stored.  Thus if the FAT is invalid,  it cannot read
	any  data at all.  This message usually means that the  disk
	has been corrupted beyond possible use.

	Cannot format this drive

	     An  attempt  was made to format a disk in a drive  that
	does not support disk formatting. This probably means that a
	FORMAT command was given specifying the RAM disk.

	Data Error

	     The data was read or written without error, but the CRC
	check  failed.   This  usually  means  the  disk  has   been
	corrupted.

	Disk error

	     The data could not be read or written to the disk.

	Incompatible disk

	     An  attempt was made to access an 80 track disk in a 40
	track drive or a double sided disk in a single sided  drive.
	This  basically  means that the disk is not compatible  with
	the drive.  Note that MSX-DOS can read a 40 track disk in  a
	80 track drive, but if the disk is written to in an 80 track
	drive  then it may not be possible to read it again in a  40
	track drive.

	Not a DOS disk

	     The  disk is not a format that MSX-DOS  can  read.  For
	example,  although  MSX-DOS  can  execute CP/M  programs  it
	cannot access CP/M disks.

	Not ready

	     The  disk is not in the drive being accessed.  The disk
	should be inserted into the drive and 'Retry' selected.

	Sector not found

	     MSX-DOS  tried  to  read or  write  to  a  non-existent
	sector. May indicate that the disk has been corrupted.

	Seek error

	     The  requested  track on the disk could not  be  found.
	Could mean a corrupted disk or faulty disk drive.

	Unformatted disk

	     The disk has not been formatted. Use the FORMAT command
	on the disk before accessing it.

	Verify error

	     Only  occurs  when verify is on,  and means  that  data
	appeared  to be written to disk successfully but  when  read
	back was found to be different to that written.

	Write error

	     Data was not written correctly.

	Write protected disk

	     The  disk is write protected and an attempt was made to
	write  data to it.  The disk should be made unprotected  and
	'Retry' selected.

	Wrong disk and Wrong disk for file

	     MSX-DOS accessed a disk once and subsequently needed to
	access  it  again,  but  found that the  drive  contained  a
	different  one.  The  correct disk should  be  inserted  and
	'Retry' selected.

COMMAND ERRORS

	     Command errors occur when a command cannot perform it's
	intended function for some reason.

	     If  an error occurs in a command and it is unlikely  to
	be  able to continue,  then an appropriate error message  is
	printed, and the next command is read at the prompt.

	     An example error message is:

		  *** File not found

	     The  three asterisks *** are printed first to  indicate
	that  an  error has occurred.  The message is then  printed,
	followed by the normal command prompt on the next line.  The
	possible errors that can occur are listed below.

	     When a command error occurs in a specific situation, an
	'error  type'  message  may also be  printed.  For  example,
	generally when a required file cannot be found on disk,  the
	'File not found' message is printed as in the above example.
	However,  if  the file required is a file specified  by  the
	redirection  symbol  <  (see  HELP  IO  on  Redirection  and
	Piping) then the message printed will be:

		  *** Redirection error: File not found

	     The possible error types are:

	Batch file error:

	     An  error  occurred  whilst attempting to read  from  a
	batch  file,  for example a disk error occurred and  'abort'
	was selected.
	Piping error:

	     The error occurred during a piping operation,  probably
	in  connection  with the temporary files  that  COMMAND2.COM
	creates  (see  HELP  IO  on  Redirection  and  Piping).  For
	example,  the TEMP environment item did not refer to a valid
	drive or directory (see HELP ENV on Environment Items).

	Redirection error:

	     The error occurred during a redirection operation.  For
	example,   an   invalid  filename  was  specified  after   a
	redirection symbol <,  > or >>,  or the specified input file
	was not found (see HELP IO on Redirection and Piping).

	Standard input error:

	     An error occurred on the standard input to a command or
	program  after  redirection or piping has been set  up,  for
	example  the standard input has been redirected from a  file
	and the end of the file has been reached.
	Standard output error:

	     An  error occurred on the standard output of a  command
	or program after redirection or piping has been set up,  for
	example  the standard output has been redirected to  a  file
	and the disk is full.

	     Many commands operate on files or directories,  and  if
	an  ambiguous filename is given then the command operates on
	several files or directories (for example the RENAME command
	or  the  COPY command).  Often an error occurs  when  it  is
	trying to perform the command on one of the files, but which
	may  be successful on one of the other files.  In this case,
	the  filename is printed followed by the error  message  and
	the command then continues. For example:

		  COMMAND2.COM -- File cannot be copied onto itself

	     The  possible command errors that can be given are,  in
	alphabetical order, as follows:

	Cannot concatenate destination file

	     This error is given by CONCAT and means that one of the
	filenames  matched by the source file specification  is  the
	destination  file.  This  is not necessarily wrong  but  may
	indicate a mistake in the command.

	Cannot create destination file

	     This  is  given by COPY,  and usually  means  that  the
	destination file for the file it is copying would, if it was
	created,  overwrite a file that was already in use.  This is
	likely to be a previously copied source file but may be some
	other file such as the currently executing batch file.

	Cannot overwrite previous destination file

	     This is given by COPY,  and means that the  destination
	file  for the file it is copying would,  if it was  created,
	overwrite   the  destination  file  of  the  file  that  was
	previously  copied.  This  usually means that  the  intended
	destination   was  a  directory  but  that  it's  name   was
	misspelled.

	Cannot transfer above 64K

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	Command too long

	     A  command that was given is too long.  This  will  not
	occur when typing commands from the keyboard,  but may occur
	from  a batch file.  The maximum length of a command is  127
	characters after % parameter substitution.

	Ctrl-C pressed

	     The command was interrupted by pressing CTRL-C.

	Ctrl-STOP pressed

	     The command was interrupted by pressing CTRL-STOP.

	Directory exists

	     A  command attempted to create a new file or  directory
	on disk with the same name as an existing directory.

	Directory not empty

	     The RMDIR (RD) command tried to remove a directory that
	contains files or other directories.  These must be  deleted
	first  with  the ERASE and RMDIR commands since  directories
	must be empty before they can be removed.

	Directory not found

	     A  directory  command (eg.  RNDIR) could not  find  the
	specified directory.

	Disk full

	     There  is no more room on the disk and files will  have
	to be deleted and the command given again.

	Disk operation aborted

	     A  disk  error  occurred  and the  'Abort'  option  was
	chosen, thus aborting the whole command.

	Duplicate filename

	     RENAME  (REN)  or  RNDIR cannot perform  the  specified
	rename  because the new filename is the same as  a  filename
	that already exists.  Also occurs from MOVE or MVDIR because
	a filename already exists in the destination directory  with
	the same name as the file or directory being moved.

	End of file

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	Environment string too long

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	Error on standard input

	     This should not normally occur from commands, and means
	that  an  error occurred while a command was  attempting  to
	read from the keyboard.

	Error on standard output

	     This should not normally occur from commands, and means
	that  an  error occurred while a command was  attempting  to
	write to the screen.

	File access violation

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	File allocation error

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	File cannot be copied onto itself

	     The  destination  file when trying to do a COPY is  the
	same file as the source.

	File exists

	     MKDIR  (MD) tried to create a new directory but a  file
	with   the  same  name  already  exists  in  the   specified
	directory.

	File for HELP not found

	     The HELP command looked for a file to get the help text
	from but could not find it. Help files are usually kept in a
	directory called \HELP on the boot disk.

	File handle not open

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	File is already in use

	     A command tried to modify a file that is already  being
	used for some other purpose, such as the currently executing
	batch file.
	File not found

	     A command could not find the specified file or files.

	Internal error

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	Invalid BDOS call

	     This should not normally occur from commands.
	Invalid attributes

	     Usually means an invalid +/- attribute was specified in
	ATTRIB or ATDIR.

	Invalid date

	     The  date  typed into the DATE command is not  a  valid
	date or was typed in in an invalid format.

	Invalid device operation

	     A  command  cannot perform it's function on one of  the
	built-in system devices eg. a file cannot be renamed CON.

	Invalid directory move

	     MVDIR  attempted to move a directory into one  of  it's
	own descendant directories, which cannot be done.

	Invalid drive

	     A drive that does not exist was specified.

	Invalid environment string

	     The  name  of  an  environment  item  contains  invalid
	characters.  Only  those  characters valid in filenames  are
	valid in environment item names.

	Invalid file handle

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	Invalid filename

	     A filename contains invalid characters.  This may be  a
	filename   explicitly  given,   or  may  be  the  result  of
	attempting to rename a file with an ambiguous new name.

	Invalid number

	     A  number  given  in  a  command  contained   non-digit
	characters.

	Invalid option

	     An  invalid  letter  was given after a / on  a  command
	line.

	Invalid . or .. operation

	     A  command cannot perform it's function on the  special
	'.'  and  '..' directories that are present at the start  of
	all sub-directories.

	Invalid parameter

	     The  parameter to a command is generally not valid  for
	that command in some way.

	Invalid pathname

	     A path specified on a command line does not exist or is
	syntactically incorrect.

	Invalid process id

	     This should not normally occur from commands.

	Invalid time

	     The  time  typed into the TIME command is not  a  valid
	time or was typed in in an invalid format.

	Missing parameter

	     A command expected a parameter but did not find one.

	No spare file handles

	     Should not normally occur from commands.

	Not enough memory

	     Not  enough memory is available for the given  command.
	For example,  a large program to large to fit into memory or
	not enough memory for a new environment string.

	Not enough memory, system halted

	     This  special  error message is  printed  when  MSX-DOS
	attempts  to  start  up and finds that there is  not  enough
	memory to continue.  As the message suggests,  the  computer
	must then be reset. This should normally occur.

	Pathname too long

	     A  path is too long.  Either the length of the pathname
	given exceeds 100 characters,  or the total length of a path
	from  the  root  directory  to  a  file  is  more  than   63
	characters.

	RAM disk already exists

	     Should not normally occur from commands.

	RAM disk does not exist

	     The  RAMDISK  command was used to display  the  current
	size of the RAM disk, but no RAM disk exists.

	Read only file

	     An  attempt  was  made to modify or  overwrite  a  file
	marked  as read only.  The DIR command shows this,  and  the
	ATTRIB command can make it not read only.

	Root directory full

	     The   fixed  maximum  number  of  files  in  the   root
	directory  (often 64 or 112)  has been reached.  Directories
	do not have this limitation.

	System file exists

	     An attempt was made to create a file which would, if it
	was  created,  overwrite a file that is marked as  a  system
	file.  System  files  are not used in MSX-DOS,  and are  not
	shown  by  the  DIR command or  accessible  from  any  other
	commands,  and  so this error should not normally occur with
	commands.

	Too many parameters

	     All  the parameters a command expected were found on  a
	command line,  but there were still more parameters left  on
	the end of the line.

	Unrecognized command

	     A  given  command  was not an internal  command  or  an
	external  COM or BAT command found along the current  search
	path as set by the PATH command.

	Wrong version of command

	     After  executing a program,  COMMAND2.COM tried to  re-
	load itself from the COMMAND2.COM file on disk, and found it
	was  not  the same version.  A prompt is  then  printed  and
	COMMAND2.COM will attempt to re-load itself again.

	Wrong version of MSX-DOS, system halted

	     This  special  error  message is printed  when  MSX-DOS
	attempts to starts up and finds that some other part of  the
	MSX-DOS  system has a version number earlier than  required.
	As  the message suggests,  the computer must then be  reset.
	This should not normally occur.

	     Internally,  errors  are represented as error  numbers.
	The  numbers corresponding to the errors above start at  255
	and decrease. If an error number is received for which there
	is  no  message,  then it is printed.  Numbers above 64  are
	reserved  for  future version of MSX-DOS and so  are  called
	'system errors' and numbers below 63 can be used by external
	commercially   available  programs  and  are  called   'user
	errors'. User errors below 32 never print a message. The two
	default  error messages (which will not normally occur  from
	commands) are thus:

	System error 64

	     and

	User error 63

	where  the  64 and 63 are example error  numbers.  The  only
	command which uses error numbers is the EXIT command. A list
	of the actual numbers for the above messages is available in
	the Transient Program Interface specification.

PROMPT MESSAGES

	     There are several situations in which user  interaction
	is  required before the system can continue with what it was
	doing,  typically  inserting a disk.  Also many  potentially
	dangerous  commands  require  confirmation  prompts  to   be
	answered before they perform their operation.  These various
	system prompts are given below.

	All data on drive A: will be destroyed
	Press any key to continue...

	     This  prompt  is given by the FORMAT  command,  and  is
	issued  to  reduce the risk of accidentally  formatting  the
	wrong  disk.  To abort the FORMAT command,  control-STOP  or
	control-C can be pressed.

	Destroy all data on RAM disk (Y/N)?

	     A RAMDISK command was given to set up a RAM disk, but a
	RAM disk already existed.  If the response to the prompt  is
	'Y',  then  any  files  on this existing RAM  disk  will  be
	destroyed.  A  response of 'N' or control-STOP or  control-C
	will abort the command.

	Disk in drive A: will only be able to boot MSX-DOS
	Press any key to continue...

	     This  prompt is given by the FIXDISK  command,  and  is
	issued  to  reduce the risk of accidentally updating a  non-
	MSX-DOS 2 disk.  To abort the FIXDISK command,  control-STOP
	or control-C can be pressed.

	Erase all files (Y/N)?

	     This prompt occurs when a DEL (or ERA or ERASE) command
	is  given specifying all the files in a  directory,  and  is
	issued  to reduce the risk of accidentally deleting a lot of
	files.

	Insert COMMAND2.COM disk in drive A:
	Press any key to continue...

	     This may occur after running a program,  and requires a
	disk  containing  COMMAND2.COM in the root directory  to  be
	present in the specified drive.  After inserting the disk in
	the  drive  (which  is  the drive  from  which  MSX-DOS  was
	originally  booted)  and pressing a  key,  the  system  will
	continue   as  normal.   If  COMMAND2.COM  has  been  copied
	somewhere else (eg.  a RAM disk) then the SHELL  environment
	item  can be set up to make COMMAND2.COM re-load from  there
	instead (see HELP ENV on Environment Items).

	Insert batch file disk in drive A:
	Press any key to continue...

	     This  may occur during the execution of a  batch  file,
	and  means  that the system needed to read the next  command
	from the batch file but found that the wrong disk was in the
	drive.  After  inserting  the disk in  the  specified  drive
	(which  will  be  the drive from which the  batch  file  was
	originally  started) and pressing a key,  execution  of  the
	batch file will continue as normal.
	Press any key to continue...

	     This   prompt  is  generally  issued  when  some   user
	interaction is required,  and is normally printed after some
	other  message  which describes the action required.  It  is
	also printed by the PAUSE command. To abort the command that
	issued the prompt, control-STOP or control-C can be pressed.

	Terminate batch file (Y/N)?

	     When MSX-DOS aborts a command prematurely (such as when
	the  control-STOP  or  control-C key  is  pressed)  and  the
	command  was  executing  in a batch  file,  this  prompt  is
	issued. If the response is 'Y' then the batch file will also
	be aborted.  If 'N' is the response then the batch file will
	continue with the command that follows the aborted command.
