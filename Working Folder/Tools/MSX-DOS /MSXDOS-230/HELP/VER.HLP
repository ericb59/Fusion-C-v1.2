Purpose:     Displays the system's version numbers.

Use:	     The version numbers of the three main components of the
	MSX-DOS  disk  system are  displayed.  Each  version  number
	consists  of three digits.  The first digit is the main MSX-
	DOS version number and for MSX-DOS 2 will always be  2.  The
	second  digit  is  the version number and  will  change  for
	future  versions that have,  for example,  had  extra  major
	features  added.  The  last digit is the release number  and
	will  change with different releases of the same version  of
	the  system which have had minor changes,  improvements  and
	corrections made.
