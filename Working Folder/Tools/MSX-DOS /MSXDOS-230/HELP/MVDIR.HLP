MVDIR
-----

Format:      MVDIR [/H] [/P] compound-filespec [path]

Purpose:     Moves directories from one place to another on a disk.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies which directories  are
	to be moved, and /H allows hidden directories to be included
	in the move.

	     The second parameter specifies the directory into which
	the directories are to be moved, the current directory being
	used if this is not given. The path must exist on each drive
	referenced by the filespecs in the compound filepecs.

	     If  a  particular directory cannot be  moved  into  the
	specified  or current directory (eg.  if a directory of  the
	same  name already exists) then the offending directory name
	is  printed  along  with an  error  message,  and  the  move
	operation continues with the next directory.  If many errors
	occur,  then the /P option will cause the output to pause at
	the bottom of the screen.

	     Note  that it is not possible to move a directory  into
	one  of  it's  own descendant  directories,  as  this  would
	produce an invalid sub-directory tree.  An error is given if
	this is attempted.

Examples:

	MVDIR COM UTIL

	     A  directory called COM and all descendant  directories
	and  files  are moved into a  directory  called  UTIL,  both
	directories  being  in the current directory of the  current
	drive.

	MVDIR \COM + \BAT  \UTIL

	     A directory called COM and a directory called BAT,  and
	both their contents, are moved into a directory called UTIL.

	MVDIR E:DIR?/H/P ALL
	DIR2 -- directory exists

	     All directories matching DIR? (eg. DIR1, DIR2 and DIR3)
	in  the current directory of drive E:,  which may be hidden,
	and  the  contents of these directories,  are moved  into  a
	directory  called  ALL.  A  directory  called  DIR2  already
	existed  in  ALL so the error was printed.  Neither  of  the
	DIR2 directories were affected at all.
