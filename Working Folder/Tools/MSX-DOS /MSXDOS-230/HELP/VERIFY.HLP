VERIFY
------

Format:      VERIFY [ON | OFF]

Purpose:     Displays/sets the current disk write verify state.

Use:	     If  no parameters are given,  then the  current  verify
	state is displayed on the screen.

	     If ON or OFF is given, then the verify state is changed
	appropriately.

	     The  verify state affects all writes to disk.  If  OFF,
	the default state,  then data is simply written. If ON, then
	after writing the data it is read back and compared with the
	original to ensure that it was written correctly.  The extra
	overhead of this means that writing is slower when verify is
	on.

Examples:

	VERIFY
	VERIFY=OFF

	     No   parameters  were  given,   so  the  current verify
	state is printed, which in this case is off.

	VERIFY ON

	     Disk write verification is turned on.
