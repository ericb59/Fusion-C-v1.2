VOL
---

Format:      VOL [d:][volname]

Purpose:     Displays or changes the volume name on a disk.

Use:	     If no parameters are given,  or if only a drive name is
	given,  then  the  volume name of the current  or  specified
	drive  is printed.

	     If  a  volname is given,  then the volume name  of  the
	specified  or  current  drive is changed  to  the  specified
	volume name.

Examples:

	VOL B:
	Volume in drive B: has no name

	     Just   a drive was given,   so the volume name for  the
	disk  in that drive is printed.  In this case there  was  no
	volume name defined.

	VOL B:BACKUP

	     The   volume   name  of the disk   in   drive   B:   is
	changed to BACKUP.
