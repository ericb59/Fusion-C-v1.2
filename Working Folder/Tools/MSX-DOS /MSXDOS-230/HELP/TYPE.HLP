Format:      TYPE [/H] [/P] [/B] compound-filespec | device

Purpose:     Displays data from a file or device.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies the files that are  to
	be displayed, and /H allows hidden files to be typed. If the
	compound-filespec is ambiguous, then the filename is printed
	before each one is typed.

	     If  /B is specified,  then data is read from each  file
	and displayed without modification on the screen,  until the
	end of file is reached.  This may have strange effect on the
	screen if the file contains control characters.

	     If /B is not given, then TYPE will look for the end-of-
	file  character  (CTRL-Z) and stop when it  finds  it.  Also
	control characters except carriage return, line feed and tab
	will be converted into a '^' symbol followed by that control
	letter so that they will be visible on the screen.
	     If /P is given,  then the output will pause at the  end
	of the screen until a key is pressed.

Examples:

	TYPE FILE1

	     Data  is read from the file and printed on the  screen,
	up to the first end-of-file character.

	TYPE *.BAT/H/P

	     All batch files, including hidden ones, are read in and
	displayed.  A  prompt is printed at the end of every  screen
	full.

	TYPE AUTOEXEC.BAT + REBOOT.BAT

	     The files AUTOEXEC.BAT and REBOOT.BAT are displayed.

	TYPE /B DIR1

	     All  files  in the directory DIR1 are  printed  on  the
	screen  and  no  interpretation is put on the  data  in  the
	files.

	TYPE AUX

	     Data  is  read from the AUX device (which may  be,  for
	example, an RS232 serial device) up to the first end-of-file
	character and printed on the screen.
