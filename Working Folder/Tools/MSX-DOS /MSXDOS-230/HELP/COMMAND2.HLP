COMMAND2
--------

Format:      COMMAND2 [command]

Purpose:     Invokes the command interpreter.

Use:	     command  is  any command that can normally be typed  at
	the prompt (such as the commands listed by HELP).

	     COMMAND2  is simply the name of the command interpreter
	on disk,  and can be executed as a normal transient program.
	In   normal  use  it  gets  loaded  and  executed  once   by
	MSXDOS2.SYS,  and  this provides the ability to perform  all
	the commands available.

	     Advanced  users may,  however,  wish to invoke  another
	command  interpreter for a variety of  reasons.  The  second
	COMMAND2.COM  may,  for  example,  be a  later  version  and
	provide  more  facilities.  If a transient program  has  the
	ability to load and execute programs,  as some sophisticated
	programs do, then they can load the COMMAND2.COM program and
	any  MSX-DOS  command can then be given.  When  COMMAND2.COM
	exits, the original program will be returned to.

	     If no command is given as a parameter,  then the second
	COMMAND2.COM  will simply issue the normal  prompt  (without
	executing  AUTOEXEC.BAT or REBOOT.BAT) and wait for commands
	in  the normal way.  It will terminate and exit back to  the
	original  command  interpreter  or  program  when  the  EXIT
	command is given (see the EXIT command). If an error code is
	given  to  this  EXIT command,  then  the  original  command
	interpreter or program will receive it and,  in the case  of
	COMMAND2.COM  and  MSXDOS2.SYS,  print an appropriate  error
	message (see HELP ERRORS).

	     If  a  command is given as a parameter to  COMMAND2.COM
	however,  then  it  will be executed as though it  had  been
	typed  in  the normal way.  The command may be  an  internal
	command or an external COM or BAT command.  After  executing
	the command,  COMMAND2.COM will immediately exit back to the
	original command interpreter or program.

	     In  this way,  invoking a second COMMAND2.COM from  the
	normal  command  interpreter  with a batch file  name  as  a
	command can be used to 'nest' batch files (see HELP BATCH on
	Batch Files), instead of 'chaining'.

	     When  COMMAND2.COM  is executed,  it  saves  the  whole
	environment,  and  then restores it again when it exits.  It
	only  sets up the default environment items however if  they
	are  not  already  defined.  Thus  the  second  COMMAND2.COM
	inherits  the  environment of the first.  Any  changes  made
	whilst  the second COMMAND2.COM is executing will only  last
	as long it does, and will be lost when it exits.

	     Each  incarnation of COMMAND2.COM uses up  some  memory
	which  is freed again when it exits.  This depends partly on
	the  number  of environment items,  and is  typically  about
	1.5K.

	     When COMMAND2.COM executes a transient program,  it may
	have to re-load itself off disk since the program is allowed
	to use the memory occupied by COMMAND2.COM. In this case, it
	uses  the SHELL environment item to locate the file that  it
	must  use  to  load itself  (see  HELP  ENV  on  Environment
	Items).  When  first  loaded from the COMMAND2.COM  file  on
	disk, SHELL is set to refer to that file.

Examples:

	COMMAND2
	A>

	     Another  copy of COMMAND2 is loaded,  and  prints  it's
	normal prompt. EXIT will exit back to the original prompt.

	COMMAND2 FILE.BAT

	     Normally  in  a  batch  file.   The  file  FILE.BAT  is
	executed,  and  when it ends the current batch file will  be
	resumed with the command after this one.
