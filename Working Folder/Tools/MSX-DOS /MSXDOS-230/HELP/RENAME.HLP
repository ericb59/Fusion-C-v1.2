RENAME
------

Format:      RENAME [/H] [/P] compound-filespec filename
		       or
	     REN [/H] [/P] compound-filespec filename

Purpose:     Renames one or more files.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies the files that are  to
	be renamed, and /H allows hidden files to be included in the
	rename operation.

	     The  second  filename specifies the new  name  for  the
	files.   A   '?'   in  the  new  name  indicates  that   the
	corresponding character from the filename being renamed will
	be used,  thus allowing an ambiguous rename. Thus '*' in the
	second  filename,  which is just equivalent to a  series  of
	'?'s,  indicates that the whole of the filename or extension
	will remain unchanged.

	     If  for some reason a particular file cannot be renamed
	(eg.  if  a  file  or directory with the  new  name  already
	exists)  then the offending filename will be  printed  along
	with an error message and the rename operation will continue
	with the next file. If many errors occur, then /P will cause
	the output to pause at the end of the screen.

Examples:

	RENAME FILE1 FILE2

	     The  file FILE1 in the current directory of the current
	drive is renamed to FILE2.

	REN B:\DIR1\*.DOC/H/P *.OLD
	FILE2.DOC -- File exists

	     All  files matching *.DOC in the directory called  DIR1
	in the root directory of drive B:,  including hidden  files,
	are renamed with the same main name but with an extension of
	.OLD.  The file FILE2.DOC could not be renamed because there
	was already a file called FILE2.OLD in the directory, so the
	error  was  printed.  Neither  FILE2.DOC nor  FILE2.OLD  was
	altered at all. If many such errors had been printed, then a
	prompt would have been printed at the bottom of every screen
	full.

	REN DOC + FILE1 *.OLD

	     All  files  in the directory called DOC  and  the  file
	FILE1,  both  in the current directory of the current drive,
	and renamed with an extension of .OLD.
