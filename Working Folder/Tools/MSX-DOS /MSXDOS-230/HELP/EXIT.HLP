EXIT
----

Format:      EXIT [number]

Purpose:     Exits COMMAND2.COM to the invoking program.

Use:	     The number is an error code and defaults to 0, which in
	MSX-DOS indicates no error (see HELP ERRORS).

	     EXIT  exits the command interpreter (COMMAND2.COM)  and
	returns the error code to the program that originally loaded
	and  executed  it (see the COMMAND2 command).  This  may  be
	another   COMMAND2.COM,   another  program   or,   normally,
	MSXDOS2.SYS.  In  the  latter  case,  an  appropriate  error
	message will be printed and COMMAND2.COM simply reloaded and
	executed.

	     COMMAND2.COM when loaded saves the current  environment
	(see HELP ENV on Environment Items),  and EXIT restores  it.
	Thus,  when EXIT exists back to MSXDOS2.SYS, the environment
	will be cleared. COMMAND2.COM will then be reloaded and will
	set up the default environment again,  providing a method of
	resetting the environment to it's default values.

Examples:

	EXIT

	     The  command interpreter is exited.  What happens  next
	depends on what loaded it.

	EXIT 40
	*** User error 40

	     The command interpreter is exited with an error code of
	40. Since this does not correspond to an error that is known
	to  the  system,  the error message is printed  by  whatever
	loaded  the  command  interpreter in the  first  place  (see
	HELP ERRORS).
