ERASE
-----

Format:      ERASE [/H] [/P] compound-filespec
		  or
	     DEL [/H] [/P] compound-filespec
		  or
	     ERA [/H] [/P] compound-filespec

Purpose:     Deletes one or more files.

Use:	     The  compound-filespec specifies which files are to  be
	deleted.  The  /H  option  allows hidden files  to  also  be
	deleted.

	     During  the  delete  operation,  if a  file  cannot  be
	deleted for some reason (eg.  it is set to 'read only') then
	the  offending  filename  is printed  along  with  an  error
	message,  and  the delete operation continues with the  next
	file.  If  many such errors occur,  then the /P option  will
	cause the output to pause at the end of the screen.

	     If the filename is *.*, then the prompt:

		  Erase all files (Y/N)?

	is  printed,  and  a reply is waited for.  If the  reply  is
	anything other than 'Y' or 'y',  then the file deletion does
	not take place. This is a safety feature designed to prevent
	accidental loss of all files in a directory.

	     If files are deleted unintentionally on a disk that was
	formatted  under  MSX-DOS 2,  then the UNDEL command may  be
	used immediately afterwards to restore them again.

Examples:

	ERASE FILE1.BAK

	     The   file  FILE1.BAK  is  deleted  from  the   current
	directory of the current drive.

	DEL *.COM/H

	     All  files matching *.COM,  both hidden and not hidden,
	are deleted.

	DEL B:\UTIL\*.COM + B:\UTIL\*.BAT

	     All files matching *.COM or *.BAT are deleted from  the
	directory called UTIL on drive B:.

	DEL B:\UTIL
	Erase all files (Y/N)?

	     All files in the directory called UTIL on drive B:  are
	deleted.  Since so many files are being deleted, a prompt is
	printed first to prevent a catastrophe.

	DEL *.BAT
	AUTOEXEC.BAT -- Read only file
	REBOOT.BAT -- Read only file

	     All  files  matching  *.BAT  are  deleted  except   for
	AUTOEXEC.BAT  and REBOOT.BAT which have been marked as  read
	only.
