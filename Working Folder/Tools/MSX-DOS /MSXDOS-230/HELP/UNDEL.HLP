UNDEL
-----

Format:      UNDEL [filespec]

Purpose:     Recovers a previously deleted file.

Use:	     The filespec specifies which files are to be  undeleted
	if possible, and defaults to *.*.

	     Files  can only be undeleted if they have been  deleted
	using  MSX-DOS 2  on  an  MSX-DOS 2 formatted disk and if no
	disk  allocation  has  taken  place  since  the   file   was
	originally deleted, which usually means that they have to be
	undeleted immediately after they have been deleted.

	     Each deleted file and directory reference that is found
	in the directory specified by the filespec will be undeleted
	if it's name is matched by the filename in the filespec, and
	if  undeletion is possible.  UNDEL can therefore be used  to
	restore  a  directory  removed  with  the  'RD'  or  'RMDIR'
	commands; to restore the contents of the directory a further
	UNDEL  command  is  required specifying  the  now  undeleted
	directory.

	     Note  that UNDEL is a transient command,  and therefore
	must be loaded from disk.

Examples:

	UNDEL B:FRED.MAC

	     Attempts  to  undelete  the  file  FRED.MAC  from   the
	current directory of drive B:.

	UNDEL A:\DIR1

	     All  undeletable  files  and directories  in  DIR1  are
	undeleted.
