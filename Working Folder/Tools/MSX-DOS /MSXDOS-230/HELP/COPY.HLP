COPY
----

Format:      COPY [/H] [/P] [/A] [/B] [/V] [/T] source dest

Purpose:     Copies data from files/devices to other files/devices.

Use:	     The definition of the source is:

		  compound-filespec

	The  compound-filespec specifies the files or  devices  that
	are  to be copied.  If /H is given then hidden files may  be
	copied.

	     The definition of the dest is:

		  [d:][path][filename] | device

	where d: and path default to the current drive and directory
	respectively.  If any part of the filename is ambiguous then
	the  appropriate  character  from  the  source  filename  is
	substituted,  thus  allowing the files to be renamed in  the
	process.  If  the  filename is not given,  then  the  entire
	source  filename  is used.  If the dest  is  an  unambiguous
	directory,  then  the  files are copied into that  directory
	with a filename of *.*.

	     COPY  will  read as many source files as possible  into
	memory before writing any out. When it can read no more into
	memory (eg.  when it has used all available memory) it  will
	write out each file in the order that it read them.  When it
	creates  each destination file,  it prints the source  file-
	name.  Then  if it is unable to create the destination file,
	an error message is printed and the copy operation continues
	with the next file. /P can be given to make the output pause
	at the end of the screen.

	     Many  reasons exist for COPY to be unable to create the
	destination,  such as a read-only file already existing with
	the  same  name.  Sometimes COPY will refuse to  create  the
	destination  because the user may have made a  mistake.  For
	example,  a  file cannot be copied onto itself,  or  several
	files  cannot  be copied onto one  file.  A  'Cannot  create
	destination'  error  may be given if the destination of  one
	file  would delete a previous source file or a file  already
	being used for something else (eg.  the currently  executing
	batch file).  A 'Cannot overwrite previous destination file'
	error  results  if an attempt is made to copy many files  to
	one file.  This usually means that the intended  destination
	was a directory, but that the name has been misspelled.

	     If  /A is specified,  then an ASCII copy is  performed.
	This means that source files will only be read as far as the
	first   end-of-file   character  (CTRL-Z)  and   then   each
	destination   will  have  a  single  end-of-file   character
	appended to it.

	     It is also possible to give a /A to the destination  or
	to any of the filespecs in the compound-filespec separately,
	in  which  case  it  applies only to  that  source  or  dest
	specification. Also /B may be given to reverse the effect of
	/A.

	     The  /V option can be given to turn write  verification
	on  for  the  duration of the COPY command (see  the  VERIFY
	command). This will ensure that data is written correctly to
	disks but will slow the operation down.

	     Normally, the destination files are given the same date
	and time as the source files.  However, the /T option can be
	given  to  cause the destination files to have  the  current
	date  and time.  The destination files will not be hidden or
	read-only, regardless of the attributes of the source files.
	The ATTRIB command can be used to change these.

	     If COPY gives a 'Not enough memory' error then probably
	reducing the number of buffers (see the BUFFERS command)  or
	removing some environment items (see HELP ENV on Environment
	Items) will free up sufficient memory.

	     Note  that the COPY command is simpler than that in MS-
	DOS  and  MSX-DOS  1 because  it  cannot  concatenate  (join
	together) files.  To do this,  a CONCAT command is available
	(see the CONCAT command).

Examples:

	COPY FILE1 B:

	     The  file FILE1 is copied from the current directory of
	the current drive to the current directory of drive B:.

	COPY /H  MSXDOS2.SYS + COMMAND2.COM  B:

	     The  two hidden files MSXDOS2.SYS and COMMAND2.COM  are
	copied to drive B:, thus making it a booting disk.

	COPY A:\DIR1 B:\DIR1 /V

	     All files in the directory DIR1 from the root of  drive
	A: are copied to a similar directory on drive B: with verify
	on to ensure that the files were written correctly.

	COPY B:

	     All  files  in the current directory of  drive  B:  are
	copied to the current directory of the current drive.

	COPY /A AUX CON

	     Characters  are read from the device AUX (which may  be
	used for RS232 serial for example) to the device CON,  which
	is the screen.  The copy is done as far as the first end-of-
	file  character.  If /A was not given,  then there may  have
	been  no way of stopping the COPY operation without pressing
	the CTRL-STOP key.

	COPY A:*.DOC B:/T

	     All  files  matching  *.DOC  (for  example   FILE1.DOC,
	FILE2.DOC and FILE3.DOC) are copied to the current directory
	of drive B:  and are given the current date and time instead
	of the dates and times of the *.DOC files.

	COPY *.BAT
	AUTOEXEC.BAT -- File cannot be copied onto itself
	REBOOT.BAT -- File cannot be copied onto itself

	     This command told COPY to copy all files matching *.BAT
	(in  this case AUTOEXEC.BAT and REBOOT.BAT) from the current
	directory of the current drive to the same place,  and  COPY
	printed  the messages to warn of this.  No data in this case
	was actually copied.

	COPY *.BAT DIR2
	AUTOEXEC.BAT
	REBOOT.BAT -- Cannot overwrite previous destination file

	     This command told COPY to copy all files matching *.BAT
	(in  this case AUTOEXEC.BAT and REBOOT.BAT) to  a  directory
	called DIR2.  DIR2,  however,  did not exist so AUTOEXEC.BAT
	was  copied to a file called DIR2,  and then an attempt  was
	made  to  copy REBOOT.BAT also to a file  called  DIR2.  The
	message was printed as a warning that a mistake was probably
	made  (in this case DIR2 not existing).  REBOOT.BAT was  not
	actually copied anywhere.
