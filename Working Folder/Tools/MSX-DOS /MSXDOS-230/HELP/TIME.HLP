TIME
----

Format:      TIME [time]

Purpose:     Displays or sets the current time.

Use:	     If  the time is given after the command,  then the time
	is set to this value (for the format see below). If the time
	is  not given after the command,  then the current  time  is
	printed  and the new time is prompted for and input.  If  no
	input  is  given (i.e. if the 'enter' key alone is  pressed)
	then the current time is not altered. Otherwise the input is
	assumed  to be a new time,  and is interpreted as  described
	below.  If  the  time is invalid then an  error  message  is
	displayed and the new time again prompted for and input.

	     The  time is expected to consist of up to four numbers,
	separated by one of the following characters:

	     space tab , - . / :

	with  spaces  allowed  either side  of  the  character.  Any
	missing  numbers will default to the  current  setting.  The
	first  number is the hour,  the second is the  minutes,  the
	third is the seconds and the forth is the centi-seconds. The
	centi-seconds  are not printed however since it is not  very
	useful to know the current value,  or indeed to enter a  new
	one.

	     The format in which the time is printed is flexible and
	can   be  changed.   An  environment item (see  HELP ENV  on
	Environment  Items) called TIME is set up by default to  the
	value '12', which indicates that the time will be printed in
	12  hour format with a following 'a' or 'p' for am  and  pm.
	The command SET TIME 24 will cause the time to be printed in
	24 hour mode.  The time can be input unambiguously in either
	format.  The  time format also affects the times printed  by
	the DIR command.

Examples:

	TIME 16:45

	     The current time is set to 4:45 pm.

	TIME
	Current time is 10:45:58a
	Enter new time:

	     No  parameters  were  given,  so the  current  time  is
	printed   (in this case in 12 hour mode) and  the  new  time
	prompted for.

	TIME 10-50-30-23

	     The time is set to 30.23 seconds after 10:50 am.
